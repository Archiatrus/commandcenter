# Modified CommandCenter for the Starcraft 2 AI Ladder

This is a modified CommandCenter that can participate out of the box in the [Starcraft 2 AI Ladder](http://sc2ai.net). The whole bot is quite complex but still generic. Thus, it is an ideal starting point for developing your own bot by adjusting the code according to your ideas.

Installation instructions can be found [here](http://wiki.sc2ai.net/CommandCenter_Getting_started_for_the_Ladder_Manager).

If you find any bugs please consider writing an issue so that I can fix them.

Note: I removed all BW API parts. The reason for this is that I have never played BW nor developed a bot with the BW API. So I can not test whether changes or bug fixes I made to the bot will break it in the BWAPI or not.
